# dpp-sampling-tutorial
A python based tutorial for Determinantal Point Process (DPP) sampling. The tutorial includes a simple manual example, as well as more advanced examples using the DPPy package.


## DPP sampling
Determinantal Point Process (DPP) sampling is a method for selecting a subset of data points such that the selected points are as diverse as possible. It uses a kernel matrix to measure pairwise similarities and assigns probabilities to subsets of points based on their diversity. The sampling process favors subsets with higher diversity, ensuring that the selected points are more spread out in the feature space.
